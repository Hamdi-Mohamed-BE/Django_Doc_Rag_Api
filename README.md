2. Manual setup
3. Features

## Quick start setup:

1. Setup env variables for local development:

   cp env.local.example .env

2. Setup docker-compose override file for local development:

   cp example.docker-compose.override.yml docker-compose.override.yml

3. Run dockerized server:

   docker-compose up

4. After docker image is built and server started, setup migrations/static files/admin access:

   docker-compose exec app sh /scripts/server_setup.sh

## Manual setup

1. Set .env variables (see comments in env.dev.example and env.local.example for details):
   1. Create .env file from development (env.dev.example) template
   2. Set PROJECT_NAME, FRONTEND_URL
   3. Set remote DB credentials
   4. Create and copy GC credentials file to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path
   5. Create buckets for static and media files and set fields GS_STATIC_BUCKET_NAME, GS_MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME
   6. Set admin credentials for script or setup them manually later
2. Set docker-compose.override.yml file:
   1. By default, all non-core services (db, celery server) are placed remotely, in this case no
      docker-compose.override.yml is needed
   2. To place some services locally add docker-compose.override.yml
3. Run dockerized server: docker-compose up
4. After docker image is built and server started, setup migrations/static files/admin access:

   1. Run

      docker-compose exec app sh /scripts/server_setup.sh for automatic setup

      OR

   2. Apply DB migrations:

      docker-compose exec app python manage.py migrate

   3. Setup static files:

      docker-compose exec app python manage.py collectstatic

   4. Create superuser for admin access:

      docker-compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser

## Features

1. Server is served at http://0.0.0.0:80
2. Swagger docs are served at http://0.0.0.0/api/schema/swagger/
3. Admin panel is served at http://0.0.0.0/admin/
4. Includes Celery for scheduled and background tasks. See app/core/tasks.py and app/settings.py for examples
5. New push notification implementation check **FirePush** -> fire_push_sender.py [**dependency** /app/service-account-file.json]


## Cloud Deploy
Simply run `scripts/deploy_prod.sh` (!!!NOTE: This is **PRODUCTION** deployment)

The script executes the command: `gcloud builds submit --config cloudmigrate.yaml`.

In particular, 
- Build and push image to Google Container Registry
- Perform `manage.py migrate` on Postgresql database instance via SQL Auth Proxy.
- Perform `manage.py collectstatic`, which synchronizes media and static file to google cloud bucket.
- Deploy the app to Cloud Run, and attach "cloud-run" service account

### Production configuration
Production configuration is stored in Google Secret Manager and synced with local `.env` file in "terraform" directory. 

Sync command: `terraform apply`.
